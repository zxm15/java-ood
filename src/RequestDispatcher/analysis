use cases

1.user send request to dispatcher
2.patcher stores the request and call dispatch method to locate a proper group of drivers
3.dispatch send updates to the drivers
4.drivers answers request
5.dispatcher update the user



thread-safe producers and consumer pattern to submit user request and confirm user request
observer pattern to handle send message to users and drivers


first step:
no worries about the thread-safe thing, no worries about the design pattern, no worries about the scalability


now the first draft is done, how to improve it?

how to wait for a driver's answer without using while true? thread await and notify
use observer pattern to send request to drivers;
use producer and consumer pattern to dispatch request
