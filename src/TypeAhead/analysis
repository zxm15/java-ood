the nature of typeahead is to take the input as prefix and match the data source

trie-tree

company name, customer name, email,  product name, sku,

for each one of them we product a local trie tree

what about the space or some other special characters in the name? we take the full name in the trie tree including space,
make it a special character in the tree node

assume now we are supporting special character such as white space, @, .com, .net, .gov,
