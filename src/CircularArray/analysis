design a rotated array

how do you want to support rotation?
there is a rotate function
public void rotate(int shiftRight)


1,2,3,4,5  shift 2
4,5,1,2,3

if I place a pointer at 4 and use it as the head, then nothing need to changed

4,5,1,2,3   shift 2
2,3,4,5,1   shift 2

5,1,2,3,4   total shift = 6

the way to calculate head = total shift % array.length; 1 represents head should be at the last element;
