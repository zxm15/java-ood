use cases:

create table;
write content to table cell
create relations between cell in table

class
table, cell, relations between cells

e.g
cell(2,2) = sum(cell(1,1, 2,1, 1,2))

parent      child

cell 1,1 => cell 2,2
cell 2,1 => cell 2,2
cell 1,2 => cell 2,2,

directed graph


list<cell> as neighbors but this is not enough because we will need to create relations between cells

list<Relation> relations

 class Relation {
    cell input
    cell output

    pass function as variable => use interface as a way of passing method as varaible


 }

 Inteface function {

    public execute()
 }

 class SumFunction implments Fuction{

    List<Integer> arguments;

    public int sum() {

        return sum(arguments);
    }

    public execute() {

    }
