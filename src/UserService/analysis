use cases:

register/unregister
login/logout
manage profile

remember me
implemented using login cookie which contains a series identifier and a hashed token
if both match with the database record, then it is autheticated. New token and login cookie should be issued to the user
if series match but now the token, it was assumed a theft. All session deleted
if both not presented, login cookie ignored.

scalability:
