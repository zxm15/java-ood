for a public API, there is limitation for the call times. Normally, you cannot call the API more the 5 times per second.
Design a rate limiter to filter the API calls.

1.Design rate limter for every second using 1 counter.

2. Design rate limiter for any second using 1 queue.

In long term, both design could limit the request number is less than 5 per second.
The second could distributed the request more evenly.
